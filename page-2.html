    <h1>internet stuff</h1>
    <p>We can find almost anything on the internet. Information, entertainment, and sometimes even jobs and chores can be found
    online. The internet has changed how we find information, but it has also changed how we get information. Traditional
    methods, such as searching the Dewey Decimal System or newspaper databases, only scratch the surface of what's out
    there.<p>
    </p>
    The internet is an enormous network of millions of computers linked together by a system of cables and routers. The
    internet is used to connect people and organizations across the world, providing an instantaneous means of
    communication. The internet is composed of websites, which are the portals to many of the world's information and
    services. One such website is the website of a company called Google.</p>
