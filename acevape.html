    <p>Crawling is the process of identifying and extracting information from websites. Crawling is the first step in the
    information extraction process, which involves identifying the topics and concepts a human is interested in and turning
    those topics into structured data that a computer can understand. Crawling is also an important part of web development,
    which involves the creation and maintenance of websites. However, website development is also an area of computer
    science that focuses on the design and implementation of software applications that run on computers, rather than the
    design and implementation of websites that are viewed through a browser.</p>
